NAME
    AAAA::Crypt::DH - making Crypt::DH installable

SYNOPSIS
      # in Makefile.PL

      requires 'AAAA::Crypt::DH';

DESCRIPTION
    AAAA::Crypt::DH is a Task distribution that makes sure that either
    Math::BigInt::GMP or Math::BigInt::Pari are installed so that Crypt::DH
    works at a speed approaching reasonable.

    If you have a dependency on Crypt::DH add AAAA::Crypt::DH as an
    additional dependency and one of the above Math libs will be installed
    before Crypt::DH.

    Why the 'AAAA'? Well, CPAN and CPANPLUS install prereqs sorted
    alphabetically, the 'AAAA' ensures that this prereq is installed before
    Crypt::DH. Simples.
